"""Utilities for working with tools in the Anthropic API.

Adapted from langchain_anthropic>=0.1.15 , see

The reason for copying instead of depending on it is that we are currently pinned to
langchain version 0.1.3, which does not have the necessary helper functions for working
with tools in the Anthropic API format.
